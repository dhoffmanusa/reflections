When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
    When working with a team. Being able to work on project from different computers

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
    Not ready to commit yet. Want to keep remote prod ready
