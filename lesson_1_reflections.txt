How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    Less data to look through. Faster finding the bug

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    See all the changes in one spot

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Might not be ready to commit those changes at that moment.
    Each commit is logical. All files work together

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    A change to a coding project might only use a few of the multiple files in the project. 
	Easier to say "Yes - blend all these in" and have it done automatically

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    Git log shows the commits and git diff shows the changes between two commits

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    Can easily back out the change if it tests bad.
    Also can go back a few versions to find bugs and fix them in current version

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    Personal coding projects
